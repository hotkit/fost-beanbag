2015-06-14  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Fixed up tests to remove use of `std::auto_ptr`.

2015-02-27  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Refactored DELETE hook, some types and header layout.

2015-02-24  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Add a hook where a DELETE on a beanbag can be dropped, or other actions taken first.

2015-02-11  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Correct HTTP DELETE return value and implement deletion of beanbags.

2014-11-11  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Fix a test so it doesn't depend on being built within the beanbag project.

2014-09-07  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added build support for Windows.

2012-08-16  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Can now set up an alias for a given database so the same underlying database can be referred to by more than one name.

2012-08-07  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 If there is no HTML content given then return a JSON response for the request.

2012-08-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Allow the database to be fetched through a virtual method so it can be overridden.
 There is no reason why converting a path to a jcursor should require the database so remove it from the method signature.

2012-08-01  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Moved the database header so that other code can also access beanbags directly without needing to go through the web server.

2012-03-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Allow PUT to be done at a new position in the JSON. Objects and arrays will be created as needed to accommodate the new data at the requested location.
 Any query string at all will force JSON response (as text/plain for now). For future compatibility use __ as the query string key. I.e. http://localhost:8080/?__=

2012-02-26  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added a raw JSON editor.
 Added ChangeLog
